Introduccion
Please review [Chapter 2 of the Foundation Level](https://github.com/BeatrizBravo/ISTQBpreparation/blob/main/subjects/2-Life-cycles.md).
And please review the ['Test Process'](https://github.com/BeatrizBravo/ISTQBpreparation/blob/main/subjects/1-Fundamental.md#test-process) section from Chapter 1 of the Foundation Level <br><br>
In the ISTQBÂ® Foundation Level syllabus, the test process includes several important steps:
1. Test Planning: Deciding what to test and how to do it.
2. Test Monitoring and Control: Keeping track of the testing progress.
3. Test Analysis: Looking at what needs to be tested.
4. Test Design: Creating the tests.
5. Test Implementation: Setting up the tests.
6. Test Execution: Running the tests.
7. Test Completion: Finishing up the testing process.
<br>

In the Advanced Level Test Analyst syllabus, we dive deeper into the activities that are especially important for Test Analysts. This helps to make the testing process fit better with different ways of developing software. <br><br>
The main focus for a Test Analyst is on:
* Test Analysis: Figuring out what needs testing.
* Test Design: Planning how to test it.
* Test Implementation: Getting the tests ready.
* Test Execution: Actually running the tests.<br>
